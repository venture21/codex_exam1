# codex_exam1

This repository contains a sample Titanic dataset (`titanic.xls`) and a Python script (`analysis.py`) that demonstrates basic data analysis.

## Requirements
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy

Install the dependencies with `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy` (requires internet access).

## Usage
Run the script to load the data, perform EDA, analyze correlations, test a simple hypothesis (survival rate vs. gender), and generate a text report.

```bash
python analysis.py
```

The results will be printed to the console and a `report.txt` file will be created with a short summary.
